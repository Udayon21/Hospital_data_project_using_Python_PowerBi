# Hospital_data_project_using_Python_PowerBi
In this project, I analyzed hospital data using Python for data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI for visualization. The objective was to extract meaningful insights from raw hospital records to improve operational efficiency.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
Processed patient records with admit/discharge dates, follow-ups, billing, bed occupancy, doctor feedback, and diagnosis types. Addressed missing values, duplicates, and format inconsistencies using Pandas and NumPy. Engineered hospital stay duration and follow-up gaps while detecting anomalies in billing and bed occupancy with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Exported cleaned data as CSV for Power BI.

Dashboard Development (Power BI)
Built an interactive dashboard to analyze:

Admissions & Discharges: Timeline of admit, discharge, and follow-up dates.
Billing Analysis: Trends in billing, patient charges, and revenue.
Bed Occupancy: Utilization patterns for resource allocation.
Doctor Feedback: Volume analysis for service quality.
Diagnosis Distribution: Common diagnosis patterns for resource planning.
Outcome & Impact
Enabled data-driven decisions, optimizing patient flow, financial performance, and resource utilization for better hospital efficiency.
